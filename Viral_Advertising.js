/* The viral advertising hackerrank solution is a coding problem that involves 
calculating the total number of people who are reached through a viral advertising campaign.

The problem statement can be found on the HackerRank website: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/strange-advertising/problem

The code solution is as follows: */

function viralAdvertising(n) {        // This function takes in one integer argument `n`,
                                     // which represents the number of days the advertising campaign runs for. 
                                    //The function then returns an integer representing the total number of people who liked the ad at the end of `n` days.
    let shared = 5;
    let liked = 0;     // The logic of the function is to first set `liked` and `cumulativeLikes` to 0 and 0 respectively, 
                        // as that is the initial starting point in the advertising campaign. 
    let cumulativeLikes = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {        // Then, for each subsequent day starting from day 0
         liked = Math.floor(shared / 2); // only half of the shared ads are liked
        cumulativeLikes += liked;      //   add the new set of people who liked the ad to cumulativeLikes
        shared = liked * 3;           //  each person who likes the ad shares it with 3 more people
    }
    
    return cumulativeLikes;
}

 /*

The logic of the function is to first set `liked` and `cumulativeLikes` to 0 and 0 respectively, 
as that is the initial starting point in the advertising campaign. 
, 
the number of people who share the ad is calculated based on 
the number of people who liked the ad the previous day (multiplied by 3). 
The number of people who like the ad is then calculated as half of the number of shared ads,
rounded down to the nearest integer using the `math.floor()` function. */
